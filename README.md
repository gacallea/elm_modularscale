# Elm Modular Scale

Simple demo/exercise inspired by an [Elm UI bug](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-ui/issues/331), and by [https://www.modularscale.com](https://www.modularscale.com). You can see it in action [on Ellie](https://ellie-app.com/gnDvh6zLnjZa1).

It was just a personal fun exericse to see how hard would it be to do it, and to check [elm-ui patterns](https://korban.net/elm/elm-ui-patterns/) out.

The code is pretty rough and it will never be completed beyond this curiosity itch level. Nor a 1:1 clone of the original site. If you need it, use [https://www.modularscale.com/](https://www.modularscale.com/) instead.

Cheers
